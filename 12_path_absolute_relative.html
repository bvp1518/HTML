    Relative file paths - the files you intend to reference are located in the same folder of your website folder structure.
</p>

<h3>Absolute File Paths </h3>
To make use of HTML file paths, the two options are either relative or absolute file paths. With relative file paths, the files you intend to reference are located in the same folder of your website folder structure. On the other hand, with absolute file paths, you refer to external resources located elsewhere on the web.
