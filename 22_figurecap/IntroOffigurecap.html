    <title>Introduction on Figure Caption Tag in HTML</title>
</head>

<body>



    <h2>What is &lt;figcaption&gt;: The Figure Caption element?</h2>

    <li>The &lt;figcaption&gt; HTML element represents a caption or legend describing the rest of the contents of its
        parent &lt;figure&gt; element.</li><br>

    <li>The figure tag is a way to group together content.
    </li><br>
    <li>It sometimes can go alongside the figcaption tag which is a way to describe the image, code snippet, diagram or
        an illustration.</li><br>

    <li>It was introduced in HTML5 and is supported in all major browsers.
    </li><br>
    <li>The benefit of the figure tag is that it adds more meaning (semantics) to the HTML document when compared to the
        image tag.</li><br>

    <li>The figure container is just a way to wrap together your image with its caption.</li><br>
    <li>If you think of a book you sometimes see an image and along the bottom a caption to explain something to do with the image.</li><br>
    <li>Within a figure element, you can have multiple media elements like images or code snippets as long as they are
    related.</li><br>

    <li>This option element can be placed before or after the content inside the element.</li><br>
    <li>There can only be one figcaption within the figure element.</li><br>
