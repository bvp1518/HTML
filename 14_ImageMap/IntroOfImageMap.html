    <ul>
        <h3>What is image mapping tag in HTML?</h3>


        <li>
            In image mapping an image is specified with certain set of coordinates
            <br>inside the image which act as hyperlink areas to different destinations.
        </li>

<br>

        <li>It is different from an image link since in image linking,<br>
            an image can be used to serve a single link or destination whereas in a mapped image,<br>
             different coordinates of the image can serve different links or
            destinations.
        </li>



        <h3> Elements required in Mapping an Image </h3>

        <li>There are three basic html elements which are required for creating a mapped image.
        </li>

        <ol>
<br>
            <li> <b>Map:</b> It is used to create a map of the image with clickable areas.</li>
<br>
            <li> <b>Image:</b> It is used for the image source on which mapping is done.</li>
<br>
            <li> <b>Area:</b> It is used within the map for defining clickable areas.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>Steps to create a mapped image</h3>
        <li>Determining Image size</li><br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Determining the size of the image is very important because if the size of the image is changed then the
                area coordinates will also require updation.
            </li><br>
        </ul>
        <li>Creating a map for overlaying the image </li><br>

        <li>Determine the coordinates of the areas that you want to map</li><br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                It can be done in three shapes which are rectangle, circle and polygon. Coordinates can be found easily
                by
                using MS-Paint.
            </li>
        </ul>
