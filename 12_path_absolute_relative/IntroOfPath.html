    <h4> Relative File Paths </h4>

    <p>
        Relative file paths - the files you intend to reference are located in the same folder of your website folder
        structure.
    </p>

    <h4>Absolute File Paths </h4>

    <p>Absolute paths use URLs that refer to a specific, fully identified location on the internet. These paths include
        a domain name as part of the link path itself</p>
