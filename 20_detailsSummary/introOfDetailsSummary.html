    <h3>What is Details - Summary Elemants in HTML? </h3>

    <ul>
        <li>The &lt;
            details&gt; HTML element creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is
            toggled into an "open" state.</li><br>

        <li> A summary or label must be provided using the &lt;
            summary&gt; element. </li><br>


        <li>A disclosure widget is typically presented onscreen using a small triangle which rotates (or twists) to
            indicate
            open/closed status, with a label next to the triangle.</li><br>

        <li> The contents of the &lt;
            summary&gt; element are used as the label for the disclosure widget.</li><br>

        <li>A &lt;details&gt; widget can be in one of two states.</li><br>

        <li>The default closed state displays only the triangle and the label inside &lt;summary&gt; (or a user
            agent-defined default string if no &lt;summary&gt;).</li><br>

        <li>When the user clicks on the widget or focuses it then presses the space bar, it "twists" open, revealing its
            contents.</li><br>

        <li>The common use of a triangle which rotates or twists around to represent opening or closing the widget is
            why these are sometimes called "twisty".</li><br>
    </ul>
