    <h3>What is Details - Summary Elemants in HTML? </h3>
    <p>The &lt;
        details&gt; HTML element creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is
        toggled into an "open" state.</p>
    <p> A summary or label must be provided using the &lt;
        summary&gt; element. </p>

    <p>A disclosure widget is typically presented onscreen using a small triangle which rotates (or twists) to indicate
        open/closed status, with a label next to the triangle.</p>
    <p> The contents of the &lt;
        summary&gt; element are used as the label for the disclosure widget.</p>
